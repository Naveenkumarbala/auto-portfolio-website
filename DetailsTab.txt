GOOGLE
Google has the kind of market capitalization that you might anticipate from one of the country's most powerful firms. Employees are transported to meetings by bicycles and electric cars, gaming centres, organic gardens, and environmentally-friendly furnishings. Google aims to improve its employees' lives and is still looking for new ways to improve their health, well-being, and morale.

ACCENTURE
Accenture is very flexible in terms of office timing, unlike TCS and other biggies they don't track you how much time you spent in the office. But managers can ask you to complete your 9 hours and they are really bothered about deliverables.
